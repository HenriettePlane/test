# notes from r programming week 1 #
R has five basic or atomic classes of objects:
* character
* numeric
* integer
* logical (True/False)

The most basic object is a vector
* a vector can **only** contain objects of the same class
* list is the exception that is represented as a vector but can contain certain objects of different classes
